#### T30.8 Tests for the eval package

Model: claude-opus-5-5 · Status: done 2026-09-25 · Depends: T30.7 · Size: ~150 · Priority: P1 · Complexity: 2
Goal: `cox_evals` has pytest tests that fail if the harness breaks, run by `just test-evals` with no network and no key.
Files: `evals/tests/test_harness.py`, `evals/tests/test_tbench.py`, `justfile`.
Plan: a fake `cox` (a script printing a canned `cox run` JSON payload) drives `run_task`/`main` with no binary and no key; tests: task loading and `--only` matching; the scripted scenario TOML round-trips through `tomllib` into the shape `Scripted` reads; the verify preset writes `AGENTS.md` and a `PostToolUse` hook config; result/token accounting from a `cox run` JSON payload (tokens, cost, exit code 2 → fail); an end-to-end dry run of one task against the built `cox` binary (skipped when none is built); the tbench adapter's self-test as a test.
Check:
```bash
just test-evals
```
Done when: the suite is green and each listed behaviour has a test that fails when it breaks.
What landed (`1ae2f87`): `evals/tests/conftest.py` (a fake `cox` shell script that prints a canned `cox run` payload, exits with a chosen code and records its argv; a `real_cox` fixture that skips when no binary is built), `test_harness.py` (17 tests: task loading and `--only`, scenario TOML round-trip incl. quotes/newlines, every task's dry-run TOML parses, verify preset files, pass/exit-2/failed-check/failed-setup/unparseable rows, hermetic flags, `--preset verify` re-enabling hooks, `main` totals and exit code, `token_line`, `find_cox_bin` precedence, a real-binary dry run), `test_tbench.py` (7 tests: pane JSON parsing, missing binary, missing key, command quoting and token mapping, non-zero payload exit, no JSON, the self-test without any key). `just test-evals` runs them.
Deviations: `conftest.py` is a fourth file, for the fixtures both test modules share. Mutation check: dropping token parsing fails 3 tests, always passing `--no-hooks` fails 1, dropping the final scripted turn fails 2.

#### T30.10 Generated Anthropic wire types (typify)

Model: claude-sonnet-5 · Status: done 2026-09-25 · Depends: - · Size: ~200 (+ schema data) · Priority: P2 · Complexity: 3
Goal: the Anthropic stream frames are deserialized into Rust types generated from a JSON Schema instead of `serde_json::Value` `.get()` chains, so a field rename or a new required field is a compile-time or schema diff, not a silent `None`. Only the types are generated; the SSE → `ProviderEvent` state machine stays hand-written (D3: own thin provider layer, no SDK). Why not a whole SDK: no Rust generator handles Anthropic's spec end to end (SSE streaming, discriminated unions, beta headers); typify (oxidecomputer, used by progenitor) is the one maintained JSON Schema → serde types generator.
Plan:
1. `crates/cox-provider/schema/anthropic-stream.json` (new): a curated JSON Schema subset — the stream events (`message_start`, `content_block_start`/`delta`/`stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`, `ping`, `error`), content blocks (`text`, `thinking`, `redacted_thinking`, `tool_use`), deltas (`text_delta`, `input_json_delta`, `thinking_delta`, `signature_delta`) and `usage`. Field names and shapes copied from Anthropic's published OpenAPI spec (source URL in a `$comment`); only the fields cox reads are required, everything else optional, so an additive API change never breaks parsing.
2. `crates/cox-provider/src/anthropic/wire.rs` (new): `typify::import_types!` over that file, nothing hand-written but the `//!` header.
3. `stream.rs`: keep the dispatch on the frame's `type` string (unknown events still ignored); each known event body deserializes into its generated type; unknown block/delta types are still ignored exactly as today. Error mapping to `ProviderError::Parse { line }` unchanged.
4. Deps: `typify` in `[workspace.dependencies]` and `cox-provider`; rows in plan §1.1, `toolchain.md` and the workspace `rust.md`.
Files: `Cargo.toml`, `crates/cox-provider/Cargo.toml`, the schema, `wire.rs`, `stream.rs`, `anthropic/mod.rs` (one `mod` line). Deviation: 6 files, because the macro needs a manifest entry and a data file; the logic change is only in `stream.rs`.
Check:
```bash
mise exec -- cargo nextest run -p cox-provider
```
Plus the three workspace commands. Every Anthropic fixture (including `live_tool_use.sse`) replays with unchanged snapshots; a new test proves a frame with an extra unknown field and an unknown block type still parses.
Done when: `stream.rs` has no `Value::get` chains for the known events, all snapshots are byte-identical, and the dependency is recorded.
Out of scope: request types (the request builder stays as is), OpenAI providers, fetching the spec at build time.
What landed (`89ab1ab`): `schema/anthropic-stream.json` (draft-07, 105 lines; events, content block, delta, usage, stop details, error; `additionalProperties` left open so typify emits no `deny_unknown_fields`); `anthropic/wire.rs` (`import_types!` + 19 tests on the generated types: every known event from real fixture frames, unknown fields on event/block/usage, missing and null usage fields → `None`, missing `message`/`content_block`/`delta` fails, unknown block and delta `type` still deserialize, and a schema sanity test that every `required` entry exists in `properties`); `stream.rs` deserializes each known event with `serde_json::from_value::<wire::*Event>`, dispatch on `type` unchanged; new test `unknown_fields_and_block_types_are_ignored`. All Anthropic snapshots byte-identical.
Deviations: 7 files and ~530 LOC including the schema and the wire tests (the creator asked for tests on the generated code). Block and delta `type` are a plain string, not a tagged enum, so unknown types parse at the wire layer and `stream.rs` still ignores them by hand; `tool_use.id` is not `required` because one `ContentBlock` type covers text and thinking too. typify 0.8 pulls schemars 0.8 as a build-time proc-macro dependency beside the workspace's schemars 1. Mutation checks: a bogus `required` entry fails `schema_required_fields_exist_in_properties`; dropping `required: ["content_block"]` breaks compilation.
